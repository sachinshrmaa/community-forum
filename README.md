# ATTC Onilne Community Forum

## Introduction

Communtiy forum is an online Q&A website for colleges and schools. The idea for making this project came due to tha lately COVID-19 situation - schools, colleges, and  works everything was locked down for months and we are all had dozens of questions in our mind, and don't know whom to or where to ask, so we eneded up making one.

It's more like a simplified version of a stackoverflow for educational intitutes, where students and teachers can questions and answer on various categories like sports, library, exams and so on and so forth.
